## Diversifying the GBIF data model ##

**Register now** for a special community webinar on 12 April at 14:00 CEST (GMT+2), 
when biodiversity informatics expert **John Wieczorek** joins GBIF head of informatics
**Tim Robertson** to offer an update on the case studies they've been exploring to understand the 
current limitations of the Darwin Core data standard. John will also share current ideas on a unified 
common data model that's capable of supporting improved and expanded publishing capabilities.

**Bring your questions !** 
The agenda will consist of a prerecorded 15-minute presentation 
(emailed to registered attendees as soon as it's available) followed by a question-and-answer session.
This discussion should spark interest across the many communities and networks of 
biodiversity data holders, users and stakeholders that GBIF and its partners serve, both now and in the future.
