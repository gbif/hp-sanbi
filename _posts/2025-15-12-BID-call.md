GBIF—the Global Biodiversity Information Facility—seeks concept notes from eligible organizations in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and
the Caribbean and the Pacific for project funding through the Biodiversity Information for Development (BID) programme.

Funded by the European Union through the Directorate-General for International Partnerships (DG INTPA), the BID programme seeks to strengthen the capacity of institutions and countries to mobilize biodiversity data, making it openly available to inform decision-making and to support 
the knowledge needs of the **Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework**.

Selected projects should address critical gaps in biodiversity data by mobilizing data, promoting its application in research and
policymaking and building sustainable networks and communities of practice committed to sharing open data on biodiversity. 

# Objectives of the call for proposals

Concept notes should describe projects that support biodiversity data mobilization by:

- Making existing sources of biodiversity data accessible through GBIF to address knowledge gaps and meet regional information needs
- Enhancing regional and cross-regional capacity for managing and using biodiversity information
- Supporting the application of biodiversity data in support of research and decision-making
- Developing and strengthening sustainable regional and cross-regional partnerships for biodiversity data sharing and reuse
- Developing and implementing mechanisms to support the mobility of skills at the regional or cross-regional level

# Grant types and funding

Two types of grants are available:

# 1. Regional biodiversity data mobilization grants
- Purpose: Build or strengthen regional collaborations to enhance knowledge-sharing, including capacity building and skills mobility,
  and to mobilize data for  research and policy that address regional priorities
- Funding: Up to €90,000
- Implementation Period: 24 months  
# 2.	Cross-regional biodiversity data mobilization grants 
- Purpose:Build or strengthen cross-regional collaborations to enhance knowledge-sharing, including capacity building and skills mobility,
  and to mobilize data for research and policy that address shared cross-regional priorities
- Funding: Up to €120,000
-	Implementation Period: 24 months		

Detailed project budgets submitted by applicants and approved by the selection panel will determine the exact funding amounts.
