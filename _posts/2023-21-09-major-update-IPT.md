*Now available for review and testing, version 3 of the Integrated Publishing Toolkit accommodates more
formats and richer data while retaining full support for current standards*

The GBIF Secretariat has announced the availability of a [new release candidate](https://ipt.gbif-uat.org/manual/en/ipt/latest/releases) of its
[Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)](https://www.gbif.org/ipt) for testing and feedback by current users.

Developed in parallel with explorations into [diversifying the GBIF data model](https://www.gbif.org/new-data-model), the first release candidate
will offer many users their first glimpse of some major evolutionary changes ahead for this widely used free, open-source software.

As a release candidate this software is intended only for testing and preview purposes, not production use.  Users should set up their
installations in test mode and register published datasets to GBIF's dedicated testing environment. Descriptions of the new features and 
how to use them will be added to the [IPT user manual](https://ipt.gbif.org/manual/en/ipt/latest/) soon.
Feedback is most welcome and greatly appreciated through the [GitHub IPT repository.](https://github.com/gbif/ipt/)
