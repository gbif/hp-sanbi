*Deadline for community input and feedback: Tuesday, 31 October 2023*

**GBIF has released a new technical document for community peer review.
The guide, Best Practices for Managing and Publishing Camera Trap Data, 
is now open for input and feedback from community members until Tuesday, 31 October 2023**

**Camera traps have emerged as important tools for monitoring the state of biodiversity and natural ecosystems.
The proliferation of data from such sensors has made data management, rather than data collection, the limiting factor
in camera trap-related research. Responding to this and other recent community developments, this guide provides
up-to-date guidelines that optimize data management and publication by anyone running a camera trap study—particularly
data stewards, data publishers, database and information managers and students working with biodiversity informatics.**
