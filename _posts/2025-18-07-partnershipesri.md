*Software integration aims to increase use and citation of open data on biodiversity among geospatial platform users*

GBIF and geographic information system (GIS) technology leader [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) have launched a new partnership to facilitate the direct integration of
GBIF-mediated biodiversity data with Esri's suite of mapping and analysis software. This first-of-its-kind collaboration aims to improve overall data quality, accessibility
and the delivery of open access biodiversity data to Esri’s global user base, empowering researchers, governments and decision-makers to more effectively incorporate biodiversity data 
into spatial analyses and planning.

Showcased at the Esri User Conference in San Diego, California, the new integration leverages GBIF’s robust API infrastructure, enabling users of tools like ArcGIS to visualize, map and
analyze biodiversity records. The integration also builds on GBIF's citation tracking programme, with users able to create sharable Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) through the use of
derived datasets for geospatial biodiversity datasets generated through Esri products. This ensures proper attribution, visibility and reproducibility of GBIF-accessed data to support
scientifically-informed research based on the findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible (FAIR) data principles.

The new GBIF integration is expected to streamline workflows for governments, academic institutions, NGOs and businesses around the world who already use Esri products. 
It is anticipated that the barriers to using GBIF-mediated data will be significantly reduced for users in the GIS and spatial planning and environmental mapping communities.
