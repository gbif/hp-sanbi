**Venue: Biological Station Drøbak, Norway, Oslo**

**Date: 3–14 November 2025**

**Deadline for submissions: 13th August 2025**

BioDATA Advanced is an international project between Norway and South Africa that aims to support students in upper education in developing skills in biodiversity data management and publishing, 
in addition to the most modern molecular methods for monitoring biodiversity. The skills taught within BioDATA Advanced are important for carrying out the everyday tasks of a modern biologist, 
though many of these skills are not taught in higher education.

This project also looks to strengthen the partnership between the South African Node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (SANBI-GBIF) and the other BioDATA Advanced partners,
through exchanges and enhanced collaborations on scientific projects of mutual interest.

**Scope:**
The scope of the course is to provide participants with practical, hands-on experience in the full workflow of environmental DNA (eDNA) research, from field collection to data analysis. 
The training will cover sampling eDNA from aquatic environments, performing DNA extraction and lab work, sequencing using the Oxford Nanopore MinION platform, and conducting bioinformatics analysis 
for interpretation of results. The course will emphasize immersive, community-based learning, fostering a strong collaborative environment.

**Audience:**
The course is suitable for MSc and PhD students in biology and other early career professionals in relevant fields. 
We plan to select 6 students from South Africa and 4 from Norway for this course.

**Learning outcomes**
- To increase knowledge about the ecology and biodiversity in Norwegian marine environment, and how to apply this knowledge for eDNA based monitoring.
- To explore the range of DNA-based methods to assess fish diversity in a fjord environment. Collect eDNA samples, extract and analyse eDNA samples on-site using cutting edge and
- portable technologies (BentoLab, MinION sequencer).
- To learn relevant processes of applying DNA sequencing technologies (MinION and IIlumina) and basic bioinformatic analyses.

To ensure full participation in the wet lab training course in Norway, attendees should have a basic understanding of molecular biology, and DNA sequencing. Familiarity with techniques like
PCR, metabarcoding, and high-throughput sequencing is expected. The course includes hands-on work such as eDNA sampling, on-site DNA extraction and PCR using a Bento Lab, and 
real-time sequencing with a MinION device, so basic lab skills especially pipetting and PCR are required. Participants should have an affinity or professional interest in biodiversity. Participants need to have the motivation and interest to conduct and handle DNA/eDNA research and data. Ideally, candidates should be familiar with programming in R or Python. A good understanding of English is necessary to follow the course, carry out the exercises, and to receive support during the teaching. Participants will also be required to bring their own laptops.

**Recommended preparation:**
Students should have R and R studio installed (some packages would also be relevant to have, like DADA2 and others), as well as access to a terminal or a UNIX session will be required.
More information on any program installations will be provided ahead of the course.

**Costs:**
No registration fee will be charged for the course. Participants will need to have the use of a laptop throughout the training. Flights to Norway and travel within Norway will be arranged for and
paid directly by the course organizers, in addition to accommodation. Meals will also be provided during the course, and participants will also receive a stipend via bank transfer of
2000NOK (3500 RAND) to cover other costs accrued during travel periods in Norway. This will be covered under the Biodata Advanced Programme (DIKU project UTF-2020/10117), which is financed 
through the University of Oslo.
