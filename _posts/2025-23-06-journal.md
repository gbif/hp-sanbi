*The scientific publication becomes the first of many titles under the Pensoft masthead expected to provide GBIF-enabled data access*

The [Biodiversity Data Journal (BDJ)](https://data.bdj.pensoft.net/) has become the second scientific journal to take advantage of the 
[GBIF hosted portals programme.](https://www.gbif.org/hosted-portals) Envisioned as the first in a series to support Pensoft-published journals,
BDJ's portal is the programme's [28th production](https://www.gbif.org/composition/4s2G3hhH1n3reU0yN0F8RF/hosted-portals-in-production) release
and follows closely behind the [European Journal of Taxonomy'](https://www.gbif.org/news/2JHV6IsWcUUrD57I3FgXIQ/european-journal-of-taxonomy-launches-gbif-hosted-portal)s hosted portal which launched last month. Taken together, the sites set a key precedent 
for scientific publishers seeking to advance and support the reuse of FAIR biodiversity data using open infrastructure.

BDJ is a peer-reviewed online publication focused on biodiversity-related research on any taxon from any part of the world. 
Pensoft and BDJ are pioneers in the growth and development of [data papers](https://www.gbif.org/data-papers), a scholarly format in which the peer review of metadata offer academic credit for data curation activities. The journal has also hosted publications resulting from three GBIF-sponsored
calls for data papers, producing a special issue on the [Biota of Russia](https://bdj.pensoft.net/topical_collection/59/) and another on the
[Biota of Northern Eurasia.](https://bdj.pensoft.net/topical_collection/197/)

The [newly launched portal](https://data.bdj.pensoft.net/) enables seamless integration of published articles and associated 
data elements with GBIF-mediated records, enhancing the visibility and dissemination of biodiversity data for authors and publishers. 
Users can explore more than [278,000 occurrence records](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?publishing_org=750a8724-fa66-4c27-b645-bd58ac5ee010&advanced=1) across [837 datasets](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/search?publishing_org=750a8724-fa66-4c27-b645-bd58ac5ee010&advanced=1) published to date through BDJ.

Records published alongside research in BDJ have in turn supported nearly [900 GBIF-enabled research papers.](https://www.gbif.org/resource/search?contentType=literature&literatureType=journal&relevance=GBIF_USED&publishingOrganizationKey=750a8724-fa66-4c27-b645-bd58ac5ee010&peerReview=true)
Key patterns also emerge from data visualizations via a customized [dashboard](https://data.bdj.pensoft.net/dashboard/), [maps](https://data.bdj.pensoft.net/occurrence/search/?view=MAP) and [data](https://data.bdj.pensoft.net/occurrence/search/?view=CLUSTERS) 
clustering feature that enables the detection of related GBIF records. The BDJ portal helps researchers explore the information that supports
its main and secondary scientific findings by providing a complete view of research results and their impacts.

By directly linking peer-reviewed articles to their associated data, this initiative promotes the open exchange of biodiversity knowledge 
and reduces barriers to data use and reuse. The Pensoft and EJT portals also provide examples for implementing the [Disentis Roadmap 2024](https://www.bouchoutdeclaration.org/roadmap-2024/), developed to catalyze commitments for liberating biodiversity data locked in research publications to support international science-policy commitments through the [Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework](https://www.cbd.int/gbf) (KMGBF)and the
[Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services](https://www.ipbes.net/) (IPBES)
